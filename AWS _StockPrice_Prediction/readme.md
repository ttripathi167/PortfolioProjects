AWS Stock Prediction Pipeline
This project sets up an automated pipeline to predict stock prices using a combination of AWS services. Leveraging AWS's scalability and real-time processing capabilities, the pipeline gathers stock data, cleans and processes it, and then trains machine learning models to predict stock prices.

Introduction
The financial industry faces challenges in processing large volumes of data efficiently, often impacting decision-making speed. This project addresses these challenges by creating a scalable and robust data pipeline using AWS services to store, process, and analyze stock data. This solution enables timely insights and real-time analytics for financial institutions and traders.

Data Source
The project uses stock data from Alpha Vantage, which provides real-time and historical stock data through an API. The data includes stock prices, forex rates, and various technical indicators, with options for different data frequencies (e.g., intraday, daily).

Architecture
The pipeline architecture utilizes multiple AWS services for an end-to-end data pipeline, including:

AWS Lambda: Executes scripts for data collection and triggers processes on a schedule.
Amazon S3: Serves as the primary data lake, storing stock data and processed outputs.
AWS Glue: Handles data cleaning, transformation, and loading into S3.
Amazon EventBridge: Schedules daily tasks to keep data updated and pipeline processes running on schedule.
AWS SageMaker: Trains and evaluates machine learning models to predict stock prices.
Methodology
Data Collection: AWS Lambda fetches data from Alpha Vantage daily using EventBridge. The collected data is stored as CSV files in S3.
Data Cleaning: AWS Glue crawlers and ETL jobs clean the data, dropping missing values and standardizing formats.
Data Modeling: AWS SageMaker performs feature engineering and trains a Lasso Regression model to predict stock prices. The models are then saved back to S3 for future use.
Steps Overview
Data Collection: Configured Lambda functions and EventBridge schedules to fetch and store data in S3 daily at 12:00 AM.
Data Cleaning: AWS Glue is configured to clean data with scheduled crawlers and ETL jobs.
Data Modeling: A SageMaker notebook instance runs training jobs, and a Lambda function triggers the SageMaker job to make predictions. Predictions are saved as CSV files in S3.
Requirements
To run this project, you need the following packages, specified in requirements.txt:

plaintext
Copy code
pandas
boto3
s3fs
scikit-learn
joblib

Usage
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to access the scripts.
Set Up AWS Resources: Configure the required AWS services (Lambda, S3, Glue, EventBridge, SageMaker).
Run the Pipeline: Use EventBridge to schedule the pipeline or run the components manually.
Monitor and Review Results: Predictions will be saved in S3, which can be accessed for analysis.
