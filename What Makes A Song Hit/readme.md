Introduction
The music industry is highly competitive, and understanding what makes a song popular is crucial for artists and producers. This project investigates the factors affecting a song's popularity, examining relationships between musical features and online engagement metrics like likes and views on Spotify and YouTube.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes 26 features across 20,717 tracks, combining data from Spotify and YouTube. Key variables include:

Musical Features: Acousticness, Danceability, Energy, Instrumentalness, Speechiness, Tempo, and Valence.
Engagement Metrics: Likes, Comments, and Streams.
Dataset Source: Spotify and YouTube Dataset on Kaggle

Methodology
We employed several variable selection techniques and model evaluation methods to identify important features and optimize prediction accuracy:

Variable Selection Techniques: Lasso, Forward Selection, Backward Selection, and Stepwise Selection.
Modeling Techniques: We evaluated Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree models.
Results
Model performances were evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics. The Random Forest model demonstrated the best predictive performance, with the highest R-squared and lowest RMSE, making it the optimal choice for predicting likes and views.

Insights and Business Value
Key Findings
Song Duration: There's an optimal song duration associated with higher views, which can guide producers and artists in structuring tracks.
Musical Features: Characteristics like danceability and energy have notable correlations with audience engagement.
Artist Insights: Data on top artists and views can help record labels and managers to tailor marketing strategies.
Application
The insights derived can aid:

Record Labels: In identifying emerging trends and shaping marketing strategies.
Producers: In understanding feature impacts, allowing for more data-driven decisions in song composition.
Listeners: By helping them discover music that aligns with their tastes.
